# proget-docker

This is the repository for the official Docker image for ProGet. It launches a single process that hosts the ProGet web app
and its background services, and also updates the schema for a connected SQL Server or PostgreSQL database
on startup.

See the [install guide](https://inedo.com/support/documentation/proget/installation/installation-guide/linux-docker)
for instructions on how to get started.
