# proget-docker

This repository was used to build the official ProGet Docker image prior to v5.3.0. It is no longer used.

The ProGet Docker image is now available from https://proget.inedo.com/feeds/ProductImages. See the
[install guide](https://inedo.com/support/documentation/proget/installation/installation-guide/linux-docker)
for instructions on how to get started.
